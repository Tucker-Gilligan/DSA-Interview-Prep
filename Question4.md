## What is a hash map?

- Hash maps are unordered associations between keys and values

## What is a hash table

- A hash table is a storage that holds the records (the key and any value associated with the key)
- Hash maps require a hash-table
- The hash-table is usually implemented internally using an array
- Each slot in the array holds a key-value pair or is empty (null)
