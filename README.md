# Study guide for Data Structures and Algorithms mock interview

1. Given a document, implement an algorithm to count the number of word occurrences.

- `Input: "Hello there, how are you? Can you tell me how to get to the nearest Starbucks?"`
- `Output: Hello = 1, there = 1, how = 2, are = 1, you = 2`

2. Given a sorted linked list, write an algorithm to delete all duplicate numbers from the sorted linked list.

3. Given a string, write an algorithm to count the number of words in the string that are palindromes. The output must include a list of the palindromes and the number of palindromes.

- Input: `"Dad gave mom a Tesla as a racecar"`
- Output: `Dad, mom, racecar, 3 Palindromes`

4. Explain how a hash table works.

5. Given 2 linked lists, where each node in each linked list represents a character in a string, write a function compare() that compares the 2 strings, i.e., it returns 0 if both strings are the same, 1 if the 1st linked list is lexicographically greater, and -1 if the 2nd string is lexicographically greater.

- Input: `list 1: B->i->l->b->o->a, list 2: B->i->l->b->o`
- Output: `1`

- Input: `list 1: B->i->l->b->o, list 2: B->i->l->b->o`
- Output: `0`

- Input: `list 1: B->i->l->b->o->a, list 2: B->i->l->b->o->b`
- Output: `-1`

6. Given a list of integers find the mode and the frequency of the mode. The mode in a list of numbers is the value that occurs the most often. If no number in the list is repeated, then there is no mode for the list.

- Input: `1, 2, 3, 6, 10, 3, 5, 6, 3, 3`
- Output: `Mode = 3, Frequency of mode = 4`
